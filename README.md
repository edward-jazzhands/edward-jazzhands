# Edward Jazzhands

Edward Jazzhands is not a professional coder yet, but he really wishes he was. Then he could quit his job doing construction renos and building maintenance, and instead spend all his time coding.

Considering I only have time to code when I'm not at my job, imagine what I'd be able to do if I actually got paid to code.
